Hello, welcome to my website. 

I am currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, ready to graduate in the June of 2023. I'm finishing my Ph.D. in Quantitative Research Methods in Education and have obtained a specialization in Educational Data Science (with R). I also hold a master's degree in Organizational Leadership from Northeastern University (Boston, MA) and a bachelor's degree of Education Studies in Math from Hebei Normal University (Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China).

My research competencies include but are not limited to experimental and quasi-experimental research design, generalized linear models, multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, advanced measurement and assessment methods, program evaluation, policy analysis, implementation science, meta-analysis, scholarly writing, and grant writing. 

I am passionate about education systems change. My career goal is to be an applied researcher who bridges the gaps between scientific research and educational policy and practice, who utilizes the processes and data that lead to the positive outcomes for teachers and students. I have kept honing my research skills by applying my expertise to a variety of research projects. Both independently and in collaboration with my co-authors, I have led several research projects and presented my papers in multiple national conferences such as AERA, AEFP, and SREE. 

My current research scholarship centers on the causal impacts of school-, teacher-, family-, and student-level factors on student performance as well as non-academic outcomes in P-12 education. My dissertation consists of two separate, causal inference studies investigating the impacts of teacher human capital characteristics, advisor-advisee relationships, and classroom teacher-student relationships on student performance and attitude. Another ongoing study is focusing on gender achievement gaps and causal evidence of teacher factors that bridge these gaps.
