## Research Motivation and Overview of Three Articles

---
## Teacher effects
“Teaching quality is the single most important school variable influencing student achievement.” (McKenzie &amp; Santiago, 2005, p.28) 

A large literature body has used teacher’s value-added to student test scores as a proxy for teacher quality (Koedel et al., 2015) and identified that .highlighter02[teacher quality has consistent impact on students’ math and reading achievement] (Chetty et al., 2014a; Kane et al., 2008; Rockoff, 2004) and later life outcomes (Chetty et al., 2014b; Jackson, 2018; Kraft, 2019). 

.highlighter02[But what are the teacher-related factors responsible for these teacher effects?]

&lt;img src="p01.png" style="width: 60%"&gt;

---

#### 1. The (arguably) most studied: teacher characteristics

&lt;img src="p02.png"&gt;

---

#### 2. The (arguably) most "argued": teacher-student relationship - "Kids do not learn from teachers they don't like"? 

&lt;img src="p03.png"&gt;

---

#### 3. The (arguably) most controversial: advisory programs - they are "evidence-based practice", but, "A waste of resources"?

&lt;img src="p04.png"&gt;

---
#### Are these factors responsible for teacher effects?

Unfortunately, causal evidence on these questions is extremely scarce in the literature because of .highlighter02[student sorting] and the difficulty of implementing RCTs in education.

In my three-article dissertation, I overcome this methodological challenge and investigate the causal impacts of these factors on student academic outcomes by: 

 - leveraging a .highlighter02[natural experiment] in which students and teachers were both randomly assigned to classrooms 
 - and implementing careful .highlighter02[quasi-experimental research design] 

&lt;img src="p05.png" style="width: 90%"&gt;

## Natural Experiment and School Settings

---
## Random assignment policy background

 - Since 2006, Chinese public junior high schools (grades 7-9) are under .highlighter02[a national law] that drives the implementation of random assignment of teachers to students
  - Details about the 2006 Compulsory Education Law in Appendix

 - .highlighter02[A national trend of random assignment] has been captured in a national survey, China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) 
  - 83% of the randomly surveyed schools across the nation reported that they randomly assigned teachers to students upon students’ entry to junior high school in school year 2013-14

---
## Advised-homeroom school setting

 - Advised-homerooms
  - Students are grouped into homerooms, put on a shared homeroom schedule, and assigned a group of subject teachers who rotate to the homeroom to teach 
  - One of the teachers serves as the homeroom’s advisor, or teacher-advisor 

 - Homeroom accountability
  - To prepare students for high-stakes high-school entrance exams, junior high schools across the nation formally test students at least twice per semester on core content subjects 
  - Teachers and teacher-advisors are evaluated based on their homerooms’ performance 

---
## Random assignment approach

 - Common approach
  - Schools create either random or stratified homerooms of students upon students’ entry to school
  - Also create teacher groups, each group has one teacher being appointed as homeroom advisor
  - Then randomly assign teacher groups to homerooms
  
 - Important note: I will provide evidence of baseline covariates balance in each article to support this random assignment
 
---
## Homeroom teacher-advisors

 - A natural comparison between two teacher groups:
  - Traditional teachers who only teach a content subject 
  - Teacher-advisors who not only teach the same subject but also advise homerooms 

 - Policy background of teacher-advisor
  - School counselor is not a professional position in China
  - Every homeroom in the country has a teacher-advisor in position to implement a comprehensive advisory program that generally integrates four core components: 
      - moral education
      - student discipline
      - student development
      - mentoring

---
## Chinese student achievement measure

 - .highlighter01[School exam score]
  - The 2006 law effectively eliminated student testing beyond school level
  - School-administered tests are designed to be fair evaluations of teaching and learning progress due to homeroom accountability, leading to high degree of within-school validity 
  - Importantly, I will .highlighter02[standardize student score] to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one within each school AND .highlighter02[only use within-school variation] in student score to estimate teacher effects. 

 - .highlighter01[Subject self-concept]
  - Serves as a robustness check to score outcome based on the substantial correlations between student achievement and corresponding self-concept (Marsh et al., 2001; Möller et al., 2020) 
  - Also has unique research value in capturing the motivational dimensions of student learning (Marsh, 1986)

## Data and Sample Restriction Criteria 

---
## China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) 

China’s first nationally representative, longitudinal survey of junior high school students 
 - .highlighter01[Baseline: 2013-14]
  - A stratified, multi-stage sampling scheme to randomly select 112 junior high schools from across the country, then randomly selected two 7th grade and two 9th grade homerooms from each school
 - .highlighter01[Second wave: 2014-15]
  - Only the initial 7th grade cohort were successfully followed up (now in their 8th grade); they will be my primary focus in all three articles because of the availability of two-wave data
 - .highlighter01[School sample restriction]
  - I make some important sample restrictions that serve to bolster my internal validity, which I detail in my proposal
  - In sum, I limit to 63 (56%) schools that were public school, reported random assignment, and eliminated within-school sorting
 - .highlighter01[The unit of my analysis is student]

# ARTICLE 1

---
## Research Questions

1. Whether and to what extent teacher education background affects student academic performance and self-concept?
2. Whether and to what extent teacher teaching experience affects student academic performance and self-concept?
3. Whether and to what extent these effects of teacher education and experience on student outcomes differ for teacher-advisors? 

---
## Literature Review

 - .highlighter01[Teacher education] 
  - Teacher education attainment, major, and training programs generally do not add to student learning (Aaronson et al., 2007) 
  - Math teachers who hold a graduate-level degree seem to positively impact student performance (Coenen et al., 2018; Guarino et al., 2013) 

 - .highlighter01[Teacher experience] 
  - The marginal effect of teacher experience is unclear 
  - The relationships between teacher characteristics and student performance are evidently not linear (Clotfelter et al., 2006) 
     - Novice teachers are less effective (Harris and Sass, 2011) 
     - The impact of experience is strongest in a teacher’s early career (Papay and Kraft, 2015; Rice, 2013) 

---
## Key Measures

 - .highlighter01[Predictor variables (baseline)]
  - Teacher education attainment: education in years; an indicator for graduate degree; and an indicator for major in Educational Studies 
  - Teacher experience: a continuous variable measuring experience in years; a set of dummy variables each indicating a certain year 
 - .highlighter01[Outcome variables (wave 2)]
  - Score: subject-matter test score on school-administered mid-fall semester exam
  - Self-concept: reverse-coded student’s response to a survey item (whether the subject is difficult) on a 4-point likert-scale 
  - Both variables are obtained separately for three core subjects, Chinese, English, and Math 
  - Both variables are standardized to be mean zero and unit variance within school 
 - .highlighter01[Covariates (baseline)]
  - Various student-, teacher- and homeroom-level covariates

---
class: center, middle
&lt;img src="t01.png"&gt;

---
## Methods

.highlighter01[Identification strategy]

 - .highlighter02[Critical assumption: random assignment of students to teachers]
  - Previously discussed natural experiment
  - Test assumption:
     - Conducting baseline covariates balance check by regressing predictor variable (teacher education or experience) against all student-level baseline covariates (especially three subject scores and CEPS cognitive test score) while controlling for school fixed-effects and clustering standard errors at school level 
     - Evidence of balanced student groups in Appendix

---
## Methods (cont'd)

.highlighter01[I fit a linear model using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression]:

`$$OUT_{ijst} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(CHAR_{jt}) + \beta_2X_{it-1} + \beta_3H_{jt-1} + \beta_4J_{jt-1} + \theta_s + \epsilon_{ijst}$$`

.highlighter01[Estimation strategy]

 - Control for school fixed-effects 
 - Control for a rich set of student-, homeroom-, and teacher-level covariates from baseline data to improve estimation precision 
 - Cluster standard errors at the school level to account for the within-school correlations among residuals

# ARTICLE 2

---
## Research Question
1. Whether and to what extent does having an advisor-advisee relationship with their content teacher affect students’ academic performance and self-concept?
---
## Literature Review

 - Advisory program as school movement in the US
  - Advisor programs have been funded by state and local education agencies (Galassi et al., 1997) and integrated into multiple school reform efforts across the nation (Jenkins, 1992) 
 - Advisory programs vary considerably across schools and findings are inconclusive (Galassi et al., 1997; McClure et al., 2010)
 - Theoretical foundations of teacher advisement
  - Extended attachment theory (Birch &amp; Ladd, 1997; Pianta, 1999) and advisors build strong connections with advisees through advisory programming (Shi &amp; Leuwerke, 2010) 
  - Advisor programs emphasize social-emotional learning (Elias et al., 1997)

---
## Key Measures

 - .highlighter01[Predictor variables (baseline)]
  - A dichotomous variable coded one for students whose teacher is also their homeroom advisor and zero otherwise

 - .highlighter01[Outcome variables (wave 2)]
  - Same with those in Article 1
  
 - .highlighter01[Covariates (baseline)]
  - Same with those in Article 1 except for teacher-level covariates are teacher gender, age, years of experience, highest level of education, and professional rank in the national teacher qualification system

---
class: center, middle
&lt;img src="t02.png"&gt;

---
## Methods

.highlighter01[Identification strategy]

 - .highlighter02[Assumption 1: no selection of teachers into advisor role]
  - Within each school, this is nearly impossible to test because only two homerooms were sampled
  - I test this assumption in the full CEPS data (results in Appendix)
  - I find no evidence of observable differences between non-advisor teachers and teacher-advisors; coupled with substantive knowledge of who is selected to be a teacher-advisor, I judge this assumption to be generally met, with some important caveats
 - .highlighter02[Assumption 2: random assignment of students to homerooms]
  - Previously discussed natural experiment
  - Test assumption:
     - Similar with Article 1; evidence of balanced student groups in Appendix

---
## Methods (cont'd)

.highlighter01[I fit a linear model using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression]:

`$$OUT_{ijst} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(ADVISOR_{jt}) + \beta_2X_{it-1} + \beta_3H_{jt-1} + \beta_4J_{jt-1} + \theta_s + \epsilon_{ijst}$$`

.highlighter01[Estimation strategy]

Same as in Article 1

# ARTICLE 3

---
## Research Question
1. Whether and to what extent teacher-student relationship affects student academic performance and self-concept?
---
## Literature Review

 - The benefits of teacher-student relationship (TSR) are well theorized from attachment, motivation, and sociocultural perspectives (Davis, 2003; Roorda et al., 2011)
 - Positive TSRs are associated with:
  - reduced disciplinary problems (Quin, 2017)
  - enhanced psychological engagement and school attachment (Quin, 2017)
  - increased academic performance (Lee, 2012; Roorda et al., 2011)
 - The overall correlations between positive TSRs and better student outcomes were found to be medium to large in several systematic literature reviews (e.g., Christensen, 1960; Cornelius-White, 2007; Quin, 2017; Roorda et al., 2011)
 - Unfortunately, existing literature on TSR is overwhelmingly correlational (Roorda et al., 2011)

---
## Key Measures

 - .highlighter01[Predictor variables (baseline)]
  - Students’ ratings on three items that ask the student if their Chinese, English, or math teacher often praise them, asks questions of them, and pays attention to them in classroom. A principal component analysis (PCA) shows that, across three subjects, the first component is the only component with corresponding eigenvalue above one and explains more than 70% of the total variation in all three items
  - I average the three items and create a single index of TSR for each subject, then standardize it to be mean zero and unit variance within each school
  - I will use the PCA first component measure of TSR in robustness checks

 - .highlighter01[Outcome variables (wave 2)]
  - Same with those in Article 2
  
 - .highlighter01[Covariates (baseline)]
  - Same with those in Article 2

---
class: center, middle
&lt;img src="t03.png"&gt;

---
## Methods

.highlighter01[Instrumental variable (IV) approach]

 - I leverage the random assignment and use the IV approach (e.g., Angrist &amp; Krueger, 1991; Angrist &amp; Krueger, 2001; Aoki &amp; Santiago, 2018; Meng &amp; Zhao, 2008; Stephens and Yang, 2014)  to .highlighter02[identify an exogenous proportion of variation in TSR and only use that proportion to estimate student outcomes]

---
## Methods (cont'd)

 - A valid IV: .highlighter02[advisor-advisee relationship indicator] in my Article 2, which meets three critical IV assumptions:
  - .highlighter01[Exogeneity]: IV is uncorrelated with observed or unobserved factors that also influence student outcome; this is likely warranted based on the evidence in Article 2
  - .highlighter01[Relevance]: IV has an impact on TSR; this is also likely warranted given the design of the advisory programs is to provide students individualized support and promote teacher-student connections (evidence in next slide)
  - .highlighter01[Exclusion restriction]: IV impacts outcome only through TSR
     - Known to be “untestable” and will be challenged if having a teacher-advisor impacts student outcomes through, e.g., channels outside of the classroom
     - I will add controls of disruptive behavior, attention issue, and after-school tutoring to the models I fit

---
class: center, middle
&lt;img src="f01.png"&gt;

---
## Methods (cont'd)

.highlighter01[I recover the causal impact of TSR on student outcomes by estimating a two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression]:

`$$(1)TSR_{ijst} = \delta_0 + \delta_1(ADVISOR_{jt}) + \delta_2X_{it-1} + \delta_3H_{jt-1} + \delta_4J_{jt-1} + \theta_s + \upsilon_{ijst}$$`
`$$(2)OUT_{ijst} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\hat{TSR}_{ijst}) + \beta_2X_{it-1} + \beta_3H_{jt-1} + \beta_4J_{jt-1} + \theta_s + \epsilon_{ijst}$$`

.highlighter01[Estimation strategy]

Same as in Article 2

# NEXT STEPS

---
## Areas that I particularly appreciate your insights and guidance

 - The measures of the Article 3 predictor (TSR) are not ideal (praise, asking questions, attention); since those are the only subject-matter relationship items the data has and I have to use them, what are the limitations/potential pitfalls that I need to note in my article and what are the ways to improve upon the current strategies I have (PCA; robustness check)?
 - Better ways to model the non-linearity in Article 1 predictor – teaching experience? 
  - The majority use binning + indicator variable models (e.g., 1-2, 3-5, 6-12, 13-20, 21-27, and 27+  yrs)
  - Some use generalized additive modeling + piecewise regression (e.g., Xu et al., 2017)
  - “Machine learning in causal inference” sounds promising (e.g., Susan Athey and others; but I am not sure if I have that research capacity) 
 - The substantive interpretation of advisor-advisee relationship effects – e.g., generalizability?
 
---
## Disclosure

I think I’m obligated to disclose that 

 - I’ve finished a very first draft manuscript of Article 2 as my job marker paper/writing sample and shared with some potential employers
 - I will present Article 1 at AEFP this March; I listed Anwesha Guha as my coauthor but all current work is mine

## Compulsory Education Law (2006) 

The Compulsory Education Law1 was amended and adopted at the 22nd Session of the 10th National People's Congress Standing Committee and issued as No. 52 Order of the President on June 29, 2006. Relevant to my research, the law highlighted that all school-age children and adolescents shall have equal right and the obligation to receive a 9-year compulsory education (Article 4) at the schools near their residency (Article 12). They shall go to school without taking any examination (Article 12). The county level governments and education departments shall promote the balanced development among schools and narrow down school quality gaps (Article 22). No education government may create key schools and non-key schools and no school may create key classes and non-key classes (Article 22). No school may expel students based on school management rules (Article 27). Legal liabilities are attached to the violations of these articles. 

See http://www.lawinfochina.com/Display.aspx?lib=law&amp;Cgid=77520 for a translation of the Law.

## Sample restriction 

 - Full data has 112 schools
 - Exclude schools who were not public school or did not report random assignment of teachers and students (N = 27)
  - In the baseline survey, administrators were explicitly asked whether the school had randomly assigned teachers and students upon students’ entry to middle school (before 7th grade began)  
 - Exclude schools who allowed for within-school student sorting (N = 22)
  - Indicated by at least one student change homeroom ID (but remain in the same school) between two waves 
 - I am left with 63 schools, which will be used in three articles
  - Student-level sample size is slightly different from article to article
